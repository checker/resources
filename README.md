## Scraping 101
Many free resources exist for helping you to crawl and scrape the vast amount of information on the internet. No matter what language you are most comfortable with, there are options for you.

### Network/HTTP Requests
Each programmatic request you make to the target website is called a network or HTTP request. Several libraries exist in every programming language under the sun to help you send these types of requests.

- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) (Javascript and Node.js)
- [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) (PHP)
- [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) (Python)
- [Requests-HTML](https://requests-html.kennethreitz.org/) (Python) - This is a fork of the Requests module linked directly above that includes full Javascript support, so that you can render Javascript-heavy web pages and extract the data.


### Data Extraction
- [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) (Python) 
- [MechanicalSoup](https://pypi.org/project/MechanicalSoup/) (Python)
- [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) (Python)
- [Cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/) (Javascript and Node.js)

### Proxies
Sometimes in order to scrape successfully without being IP-banned or rate-limited, you need to use a number of different IP addresses that you switch out automatically with each request to the target server. These IP addresses are called proxies.

#### **Sites not endorsed by us**
These are sites that provide seemingly free proxies, but their quality and effectiveness is unknown. Be aware that these sites might be tracking your use of the proxies, so keep that in mind. Use at your own risk!
